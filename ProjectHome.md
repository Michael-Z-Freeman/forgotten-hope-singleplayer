## Introduction ##

This is a community and [official](http://fhpubforum.warumdarum.de/index.php?topic=16801.0) issue tracker for _single player and co-op_ [Forgotten Hope](http://forgottenhope.warumdarum.de/) Battlefield 2 modification. If your bug is a multiplayer one or is not related to single player then please report in the [MP Bug Reporting Forum](http://fhpubforum.warumdarum.de/index.php?board=19.0) section. See the [Forgotten Hope single player forum section](http://fhpubforum.warumdarum.de/index.php?board=63.0) for general single player issues.

Please [read the FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/forgotten-hope-singleplayer/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions) before submitting new issues.

Please note that ...

Actual fixes to issues submitted may become candidates for inclusion in the official FH2 mod. But ...
  * Work must be based on an unmodified official FH2 release (apart from whatever fix is being submitted).
  * It must be recorded what has been changed.
  * It must be recorded _why_ it has been changed.
  * Document any Multi Player side effects.
  * Record anything else that could help in the examination of a fix.

Only when these conditions have been satisfied and the fix has been examined by official FH2 staff will fix be considered for inclusion.

If you would like to help with triaging new issues on this tracker then please [contact me through the FH forum](http://fhpubforum.warumdarum.de/index.php?action=profile;u=84), and I will make you into a Project committer.

If you don't already have a Google account you [will need to make one](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount) and log in to be able to enter new issues.
