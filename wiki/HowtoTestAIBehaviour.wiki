#summary How to properly test the AI behaviour.

= Introduction =

Because the reactive AI is based on the rules of fuzzy logic agents it is not possible to do tests that always have a consistent answer to them. However there are a few procedures that can be used.

= Testing in game =

There are some console commands that can make your in game character undetectable to the AI. This assists in observing AI behaviour without your own interaction interfering with observation.

The following custom vehicle could be used to do the same thing in the air (untested).

= Setting variable in game =

Some commands exist to set variables in game.

Settingsmanager Commands

{{{
These commands set a range of variables. E.g. SettingsManager.boolSet GSUseObjectCache 1. The command used must match the type of variable (e.g. .boolset for Boolean variables, .IntSet for variables requiring integer input, etc.)

SettingsManager.stringSet -

SettingsManager.boolSet -

SettingsManager.IntSet -

SettingsManager.floatSet -

SettingsManager.u32Set -

SettingsManager.stringGet -

SettingsManager.boolGet -

SettingsManager.intGet -

SettingsManager.floatGet -

SettingsManager.U32Get - 
}}}

aibehaviours.ai uses float values so some of them should be settable in game without having to restart every time.
